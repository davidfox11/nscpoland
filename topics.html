                           <p>
                              The technological developments that profoundly impact the world in which we live grant us new unexplored possibilities as well as challenges. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/report-10-million-self-driving-cars-will-be-on-the-road-by-2020-2015-5-6">Self-driving cars</a>, machines that cook complicated meals for us, algorithms that automatically respond to emails and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/inside-amazon-go-a-store-of-the-future.html">stores</a> that are capable of selling products without
                              any type of human interaction with the customer are all types of automation. All these technologies increase our productivity and improve our lives. Yet, many are concerned about the fact that their use will substitute work activities currently performed by humans. According to Article 23 of the Universal Declaration
                              of Human Rights, everyone has the right to work. With automation, the basic viability of this proposition is questioned. How can we be sure that every human will be able to work knowing that automation threatens to replace such a significant percentage of the workforce? As a society, it is our job to decide and come up
                              with policies and solutions about how we should integrate these technological developments in our industries. Are we finally being outcompeted? Knowing that the European Union is <a href="https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/world-robotics-report-2016">leading the global race towards automation</a>, how will it adapt to this new chapter of the history of employment?

                           <p>
                              The scale in which 21st century automation is impacting employment is regularly compared to the scale of shifts resulting from agriculture or manufacturing that we have seen in the past. In the past century, human labour has been constantly replaced through different innovations, often introduced through the means of technology.
                              Automation has been an ongoing trend and the concerns of it replacing jobs go all the way back to the Roman Emperor Vespasian <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html">who refused to make use of a labour-saving machine</a> in order to protect the workforce. In general, <a href="http://bruegel.org/2017/04/do-we-understand-the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-on-employment/">automation affects employment</a> either negatively - by replacing workers - or positively - by increasing the
                              demand for labour or by creating new jobs. When automobiles were introduced, even though horse related jobs were reduced, a lot of other jobs were created not only in the transportation sector, but also in other sectors with the introduction of drive thrus and motels, for example. In general, the long term impact that automobiles
                              had was positive for employment since it increased productivity and generated more labour than what it displaced. With this in mind, one question is constantly asked: is the impact of 21stcentury automation indeed positive? To answer this question, it is important to note that <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/the-four-global-forces-breaking-all-the-trends">Artificial Intelligence (AI)‚Äôs disruption of society</a>
                              is happening ten times faster and at 300 times the scale when compared to the 18th century Industrial Revolution. It is hard to measure if this is the time when we finally get outcompeted by our tools. Either way, it‚Äôs still up to us and to our policies to decide how we integrate these developments in our societies.
                           </p>
                           <img src="images/empl_two.png" width="100%" />
                           <p>
                                 One argument in favour of this 21st century wave of automation and AI is that it actually makes our <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/smartsheet-automation-makes-workforce-more-human-2018-2">jobs more human</a>. This results from the argument about how <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2018/08/14/artificial-intelligence-will-replace-tasks-not-jobs/#6986a7e9a7fa">only some of the tasks</a> of our jobs will actually be replaced by automation and that these will mostly be the repetitive and mundane tasks. Since creativity and sensing emotions
                                 are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation">core to the human experience and difficult to automate</a>, this time saved can be used for workers to develop their skills further and <a href="https://qz.com/1054034/automation-may-take-our-jobs-but-itll-restore-our-humanity/">produce more meaningful work</a>.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 With simpler tasks being automated, the remaining tasks will require more social and emotional skills and more advanced cognitive capabilities. This might result in a decline in the number of low-skilled jobs with some reports claiming that <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/50-of-low-skilled-jobs-will-be-replaced-by-ai-and-automation-report-claims/">50% of low-skilled jobs will be automated</a>. Other reports claim that not only low-skilled jobs
                                 are threatened by automation. Middle-skill jobs might initially require more training, but just like low-skilled jobs, after the skill is learned, it will eventually stop involving a lot of critical thinking. Examples of this are machine operators and office clerks. This makes them easier to automate and therefore, it is likely that
                                 <a href="https://qz.com/1010831/the-middle-skill-job-is-disappearing-in-rich-countries/">middle-skill workers end up displaced</a>. This raises many issues: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4553243/">job loss is an involuntary life event that deeply impacts the life and career of a worker</a>. It might result in family disruption, social withdrawal and more far-reaching psychological damage. Not only would the displaced individual be severely affected, with the decline
                                 of low-skilled and middle-skilled jobs, but automation might also contribute to increasing inequality. After all, who owns the robots?
                              </p>
                              <img src="images/empl_three.png" width="100%" />
                              <p>
                                 There are <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610005/every-study-we-could-find-on-what-automation-will-do-to-jobs-in-one-chart/">dozens of studies published online</a> about the impact of automation on employment. Many advocate that automation will be destructive of our jobs, and that millions of people might go unemployed because of it. Others advocate that our <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2018/08/14/artificial-intelligence-will-replace-tasks-not-jobs/#2618ce8a7fa4">tasks will simply change</a> within many of our current jobs. Accordingly, the description of the
                                 impacts of automation differs between studies by different authorities, complicating the debate in the area significantly.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 It is hard to predict if we are indeed facing an old issue, or if automation has finally reinvented itself to the point in which the shift is too major to bear. Is AI going to take most of our jobs or will it only make them change? Will new jobs be created now that our tools are so significantly different? Will low and middle-skilled
                                 work disappear? Will big corporations increase in size threatening humanity‚Äôs common goal to achieve equality? Will the 23rd article of the Universal Human Rights Declaration be internationally upheld?
                              </p>
                              <h3>5. What has been done so far?</h3>
                           <p>
                              The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights_en">European Pillar of Social Rights</a> is focused on granting equal opportunities and access to the labour market, fair working conditions and social inclusion for all Europeans. It is through it that the EU safeguards the rights regarding labour of its citizens.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              One major focus of the EU is to close the skills gap. This will allow low and middle-skilled workers to seek training and develop new skills that will hopefully bring them enough expertise to stay in the labour market. Considering that it is predicted that automation
                              will increase and create many high-skilled jobs, it is important to widen the skillsets of europeans so they can accurately adapt and respond to automation. More than this, it is also likely that with the rise of automation, humans will have to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/278769">perform multiple jobs 
                              throughout their careers</a>, thus requiring a wider set of skills. This process has already been started as it is proven that more and more people tend to switch jobs on a more frequent occasion than before globalisation. To close the skills gap, the EU promotes the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1223&langId=en">New
                              Skills Agenda for Europe</a> which consists of 10 different actions to make the right training available to EU citizens. More than this agenda, the EU also makes <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1146&langId=en">country specific recommendations</a> to guide Member States into designing their own concrete policies. These policies
                              are then put into practice thanks to EU Funding from funds such as the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/esf/home.jsp?langId=en">European Social Fund</a>, the EU programme for Employment and Social Innovation or even Erasmus+.

It is based on employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. Each year the Member States draw National Action Plans on Employment and are obliged to provide the European Commission reports about their implementation.
                              The EES is in itself a part of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european-semester/framework/europe-2020-strategy_en">European 2020 growth strategy</a> which sets goals and targets for 2020 and for the Member States to aim towards.

                              <p>
                                    In 2019, women are still greatly underrepresented in the job market. Science-focused jobs and senior positions across all industries are still dominated by men, with only <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/9643473/3-07032019-BP-EN.pdf/e7f12d4b-facb-4d3b-984f-bfea6b39bb72">17%</a> of senior positions in the EU being filled by women.

                                    Additionally, there is a big gap in fields related to science, technology, math and engineering. While <a href="https://www.studyinternational.com/news/europe-male-stem-graduates-outnumber-women-2-to-1/">women dominate all levels of tertiary education</a> (apart from doctoral level studies) and graduate at a higher rate (<a href="https://www.studyinternational.com/news/europe-male-stem-graduates-outnumber-women-2-to-1/">57.6%</a>) than men,  there are twice as many male graduates in science, mathematics, computing, engineering, manufacturing and construction, than female graduates.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    As the world is increasingly becoming more digitised, there is a high demand for high-quality leadership, and gender gaps amongst leadership positions in STEM fields are the main villains in preventing the optimisation of potential in the job market.

Examples of such organisations are <a href="https://womenlobby.org/Mission-vision-and-values-588?lang=en">European Women‚Äôs lobby and Karat.</a>

                                    <b>Individual companies and employers</b> - The actions, frameworks and decisions of individual businesses largely influence the direction of the job market. As company culture and reputation are important factors when choosing a workplace, big players in specific industries, such as STEM, often have a big influence on how attractive the industry is for people of specific genders.

                                    <b>Local governments</b> - In many countries, social policies and frameworks dictate the opportunities women have to build and maintain a career and in what areas they are more likely to succeed. For example, due to ambitious <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/gender-equality-in-stem-is-possible/">social and welfare policies</a>, nordic countries <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/12/nordic-countries-women-equality-gender-pay-gap-2018/">lead in many areas within gender equality</a>.

                                    <b>Educational institutions</b> - Institutions such as universities and schools play a big role as the STEM gap often starts at a higher-education level where women are far less represented in STEM subjects. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    <b>European Institute for Gender Equality <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/">(EIGE)</a></b> -  EIGE is an autonomous body of the European Union. It was established to strengthen the promotion of gender equality across the Union. This includes gender mainstreaming in all EU policies and the resulting national policies, and the fight against discrimination based on sex, as well as to raise EU citizens‚Äô awareness of gender equality.

                              <p>
                                    <b>Gender stereotypes</b> -  while the gender gap in science is constantly decreasing, gender stereotypes and stereotypes surrounding ‚Äúmale‚Äù vs ‚Äúfemale‚Äù jobs and careers are still hindering women from entering male-dominated industries. This is also applicable  to education, where a high representation of men within subjects such as engineering, maths and sciences, sometimes discourages women from applying to or attending courses due to the small percentage of female peers. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    <b>Social and legal frameworks</b> - frameworks regarding areas such as parental leave, sick leave and flexible working often hinder women from reaching certain positions or having certain jobs, due to their family commitments. 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    <b>Social and biological pressures</b> - by nature, many women become pregnant in their 20s-30s, meaning that they need time off from work or university. Due to a lack of supporting structures, they are often unable to pursue careers at the same time as stereotypes and expectations often influence the opportunities presented to them. For example, younger women are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/12/managers-avoid-hiring-younger-women-maternity-leave">less likely</a> to be hired, as managers fear they will possibly need maternity leave.

                              <p>
                                    <b>The ‚Äúright way‚Äù to go about this issue</b> - while some believe that as society evolves, gender gaps will naturally close in the job market, others believe that the best way to combat the issue is by implementing quotas on various levels of businesses and education, outlining specific percentages of how many women need to fill certain positions and industries. 
                              </p>

                                    In the EU, there is a variety of frameworks and initiatives in place to encourage gender equality and increase female participation in the labour market. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/gender-equality/gender-equality-strategy_en">The Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality</a> is a framework for the <b>European Commission's future work towards full gender equality</b>, focusing on five priority areas, including female representation in the labour market and reducing the gender pay gap.

                                 The textile and clothing industry is one of the <b>biggest polluters</b> in the world and due to its rapid growth, it‚Äôs industrial pollution is also on a <b>rapid rise</b>. Predictions say that pollution and waste production of the industry are bound to increase by 50% by 2030. It‚Äôs <b>detrimental societal and environmental effects</b> are already felt all around the globe. The effects are noticeable at the very beginning of the production cycle, staying present throughout the item‚Äôs usage and far surpassing its lifespan. Most items end up being incinerated or dissolved in landfills presenting an imminent ecological threat to soil, air, and water systems as well as human physical and mental wellbeing. If the suggested solutions are not implemented accordingly and new methods are not developed, the industry will play a big role in the decline of life as we know it and will continue to prevent the improvement of living conditions across the world.

                              <p>
                                    The industry <b>employs a high number of workers</b> through the process of production. It plays a big role in the EU‚Äôs income as it is the <a href="https://shenglufashion.com/2018/08/16/wto-reports-world-textile-and-apparel-trade-in-2017/">second-largest exporter of clothing and textiles</a> in the world, with 48 billion euros worth of products. Behind those figures hide the workers of <a href="https://cleanclothes.org/news/2016/02/02/european-garment-workers-face-forced-overtime-and-poverty-wages">Eastern</a> and <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2016/02/09/fashion-victims-even-in-eu-garment-workers-face-tough-conditions-01-12-2016/">southern Europe</a> who are paid a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A13oK-uF_o">minimum wage to work over hours for big brands in detrimental conditions. <a href="http://www.osha.mddsz.gov.si/resources/files/pdf/E-fact_30_-_Occupational_safety_and_health_in_the_textiles_sector.pdf">Most common results of working in the European textile and clothing industry</a> are high numbers of <b>musculoskeletal disorders</b> (MSDs) in workers. There is an undeniably <b>high risk of accidents</b> and <b>exposure to chemical, biological and physical agents, dust and fibres</b> which have a significant impact on the workers, some especially harmful to women who comprise more than <a href="http://www.businessbeyondborders.info/road-to-paris-10-facts-about-the-eu-textile-industry/">70% of the EU's textile work force</a>. There is a recorded <a href="http://www.osha.mddsz.gov.si/resources/files/pdf/E-fact_30_-_Occupational_safety_and_health_in_the_textiles_sector.pdf">higher risk</a> of nasal, laryngeal and bladder cancer, allergies and respiratory disorders, and hearing damage. Fast-paced and repetitive work with no influence can cause stress and psychosocial issues in employees. The EU imports 121 billion euros worth of textiles, 70% of that from Asian countries, with <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/140841REV1-Workers-conditions-in-the-textile-and-clothing-sector-just-an-Asian-affair-FINAL.pdf">high exploitation rates of workers</a>, who work in much more <b>hazardous conditions</b>.

                              <h4>Production</h4>
                              <p>
                                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Environmental-and-social-impact-of-textile-manufacturing-processes_fig1_281104248">Fibre production</a> is highly polluting, as it has serious ecological and societal impacts. Excessive usage of <b>pesticides</b> and <b>synthetic fertilisers</b>, harmful to the environment, workers‚Äô and locals‚Äô health. Furthermore, the production causes soil exhaustion and destruction of self-regeneration capacity, disturbance of water balance and usage of land suitable for agriculture. Dyeing and finishing of the products is also gravely polluting due to large consumption of water and energy, usage of more <b>toxic chemicals</b>, such as <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/help/glossary/eper-chemicals-glossary/halogenated-organic-compounds-aox">AOX</a>, formaldehyde and heavy metals, to dye fabrics, using up to 150 liters of water per kilogram of fabric. The aforementioned chemicals are <b>dangerous to workers‚Äô health</b>, are highly <b>non-degradable</b> and the main culprit for polluted <b>wastewater</b>. At the stage of clothes production, <a href="https://edgexpo.com/fashion-industry-waste-statistics/">15% of fabric ends up as waste</a>. Many times companies do not appropriately or <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/633143/EPRS_BRI(2019)633143_EN.pdf">realistically ‚Äúcare label‚Äù their products</a>. 
                              </p>
                              <h4>Natural VS Manmade materials</h4>
                              <p>
                                    Natural fibres have the biggest impact on the environment. <b>Cotton</b> accounts for more than 43% of the materials used on the EU market. While the production of cotton uses 3% of the world‚Äôs arable land, it is responsible for <a href="https://edgexpo.com/fashion-industry-waste-statistics/">24% of insecticides, 11% of pesticides and 20,000 liters of water for only one kilogram of cotton</a>. Such water consumption contributes to excessive water scarcity. Other natural materials such as <b>silk</b> and <b>wool</b> cause <b>depletion of natural resources</b> and contribute <b>greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions</b>. However, the industry is trying other natural fibres such as <b>linen, nettle, hemp, flex and sustainable cotton</b>, whose production is greener. While <b>polyester</b> production requires smaller amounts of water it is not biodegradable but can be recycled into virgin fibres. The industry has recently been experimenting with <b>biobased polyester</b>. One of the promising solutions is the <b>natural <a href="http://resource.download.wjec.co.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/vtc/2016-17/16-17_1-3/website/pdf/_eng/_wjec/textiles-1/materials-resource-2.pdf">man-made</a> cellulosic (MMC)</b>, renewable and biodegradable, however, with a short-lifespan.
                              </p>
                              <h4>Low clothing utilisation VS Consumer use</h4>
                              <p>
                                    On average EU citizens yearly buy <b>9.5 million tonnes of new clothes and textiles</b>. Meanwhile, more than <a href="https://globalfashionagenda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GFA17_Call-to-action_Poluc-brief_FINAL_9May.pdf">30% of clothes</a> in their wardrobes have not been used for at least a year. Convincing consumers to buy less could have grave impacts on the business profit and economy as the EU is a top market for textiles and fashion with a <b>high rate of consumption per capita</b>. This phenomenon is the result of a decrease in prices, fast transportation and fast fashion chains presenting high numbers of different collections every year. By doubling the average number of times a garment is worn, GHG emissions would be <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Full-Report.pdf">44% lower</a>. However, the <a href="https://www.clevercare.info/en">up-keeping of clothes</a> has the <a href="http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC85895/impro%20textiles_final%20report%20edited_pubsy%20web.pdf">biggest environmental footprint</a> in the life cycle of textiles, due to high usage of water, energy, chemicals and shedding of  microplastics into water. As one laundry of polyester, nylon and acrylic clothes discharges <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/fibres_from_polyester_clothes_could_be_more_damaging_marine_life_than_microbeads_509na1_en.pdf">700 000 toxin releasing microplastic fibres</a> into the environment.
                              </p>
                              <h4>End of life VS Continuity </h4>
                              <p>
                                    Data shows that a maximum of <b>20%</b> of all used textiles and clothes are <b>gathered</b> in the EU. Out of these only 50% are recycled, while others are <a href="https://globalfashionagenda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GFA17_Call-to-action_Poluc-brief_FINAL_9May.pdf">most commonly</a> <b>incinerated</b> or end up releasing methane in <b>landfills</b>. Some clothes, however, do continue their lives in <b>second-hand shops</b>. The problem of gathering textiles in the EU is the lack of consistency between Member States, as some gather large quantities, others barely any. The reason for gathering textiles is to, later on, recycle them and support the case of <a href="https://circularfashion.com/circular-fashion-definition/">circular fashion</a>. The other cause for the low amount of recycled clothes, is <b>lack of recycling technology</b>. As clothes are a big polluter, adequate technology to recycle and turn them into <b>virgin fibres</b> is highly needed. For now, the majority of recycled clothes are being mechanically <b>down-cycled</b>, <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/633143/EPRS_BRI(2019)633143_EN.pdf">cut up or shredded</a>, <b>losing 75% of their original value</b>. Current technological advances make it possible for polyester and nylon to be chemically recycled into high-quality virgin fibres.
                              </p>
                              <h4>Fast fashion VS Slow Fashion</h4>
                              <p>
                                    Rise in buying big amounts of clothes and their low utilisation is the cause of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOA0D0i5-fA">fast fashion</a>. The low price for consumers is a high price for oftentimes <b>exploited workers</b> and <b>low levels of sustainability</b>. The fast transport of products to the EU accounts for 2% of the industry's climate-changing impacts, the bigger problem is the excessive packaging. The <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Full-Report.pdf">multinational fast-fashion chains</a> have recently started their <b>sustainability campaigns</b> and research for new technologies. Slow fashion which is to be sustainable is on a slow rise, with its prime idea to buy <b>less, better quality and for longer</b>, proposing a <b>change in the economic model of selling clothes</b>. Its benefits also threaten the economic survival of the producers, therefore, the <b>prices are higher</b> and <b>affordability lower</b>. Oftentimes this turns off the big consumers, alongside with the less polished style and the notion of recycled clothes being of lower quality.

                                 <p>
                                       The EU is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/humanitarian-aid/water-sanitation-hygiene_en">world‚Äôs largest donor</a> in the water sector, granting access to improved water supply and sanitation facilities to millions in developing countries. However, <a href="https://www.right2water.eu/about">1 million people in Europe lack access to clean drinkable water</a>, mostly due to economic and infrastructural barriers. This prompted demands for <b>universal access to water</b> and sanitation services to all the EU‚Äôs population, such as those by European Citizens Initiative (ECI) <b>Right2Water</b> in 2012. However, six years after the campaign, the EU institutions still have not addressed all the requests. Furthermore, it is projected that <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/news/more-floods-and-water-scarcity-ahead-there-still-time-mitigate-their-severity">around 100 million Europeans may face <b>water scarcity</b> in the near future</a> due to overconsumption of water, but also due to <b>water quality</b> problems, such as point source pollution, single identifiable localised sources of pollution. This requires not only increased access to water but also preserving it for those who already have it.

                                 <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
                                 <h4>Employment opportunities VS working conditions</h4>
                                 <p>
                                       While a large majority of the EU population enjoys reliable access to clean drinking water, 1 million of them lack this essential provision. This is mostly due to <b>lacking infrastructure</b> in remote areas, which requires a large upfront investment into plumbing or other sources of water supply. In addition, poor people may face a lack of funds to regularly pay for their water, leading to being cut off from the network. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/opinion/time-to-invest-in-europes-water-infrastructure/">The ageing infrastructure</a>, especially in less developed Member States, contributes to water leaks, pollution of the system by harmful substances etc.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       Drinking water has to be clean, safe and wholesome, not containing unallowed concentrations of microorganisms, parasites or harmful substances that could pose a danger to human health. Thus, ensuring proper <b>water quality</b> is essential. Water suppliers and public health agencies of Member States monitor drinking water to ensure it complies to these microbiological and chemical standards. While the EU can act on certain aspects of the water industry, such as public health and environmental protection, most decisions on water provisions remain in the hands of <b>national and local governments</b>. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       Occasionally, large groups of people temporarily do not have reliable access to drinking water, due to <b>point and diffusive sources of water pollution</b>. Leaks of chemical waste, greywater or other agents or improper treatment of wastewater may lead to increased concentrations of chemical substances and microorganisms, making it unsafe for human consumption. Certain environmental hazards, such as floods and droughts, may also lead to problems with water supply. Ensuring reliable access to clean drinking water is, therefore, a question of <b>environmental protection</b> and proper <b>risk management</b>.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       Finally, as human activity continues contributing to global warming, increasing water abstraction compared to its supply may lead to <b>water scarcity</b> in large areas of the EU, affecting millions of Europeans. Some of the largest consumers of water are agriculture, nuclear and coal electric plants and industries. Many such applications unnecessarily use drinkable water. <b>Water reuse</b> is <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/reuse.htm">underutilised</a>, mostly due to limited awareness of potential benefits and lack of supportive and coherent framework. Furthermore, old piping may leak up to <a href="https://www.danva.dk/media/3645/eureau_water_in_figures.pdf">50% of water</a> on its way to end users.

                                 <p>
                                       European water legislation exists since the 1970s, with standards for waters used for drinking water abstraction and binding quality targets for drinking water. In 1998, <b>Directive 98/83/EC - <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=legissum:l28079">Drinking Water Directive (DWD)</a></b>, reviewed the quality standards. It applies to water intended for human consumption: all distribution systems serving more than 50 people, drinking water from tankers, in bottles and food processing. It laid out a total of 48 microbiological, chemical and indicator parameters which must be monitored and tested regularly, using the <a href="https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/gdwq2-vol1/en/">WHO‚Äôs guidelines</a> and SCHER‚Äôs opinion as the scientific basis. Its main principles are planning, regulation, monitoring, and information and reporting. <b>Member States</b> may regulate additional parameters or set higher standards than those in DWD. Additionally, they have to ensure the information on drinking water quality is available to the consumers and submit a report on the quality of water to the European Commission every three years.

                                       In 2000, the <b><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=legissum:l28002b">EU Water Framework Directive</a></b> expanded the scope of water protection to all surface waters and groundwater, introduced ‚Äúpolluter pays principle‚Äù to encourage sustainable use and combined ecological protection and quality standards. It establishes water management based on river basins - the natural geographical and hydrological units. Its main principle is ‚Äú<b>Water is not a commodity</b>‚Äù.

                                 <h3>1. The topic at a glance</h3>
                                 <p>
                                       Information warfare is a term which involves the battlespace use of information and communication technologies. There are several examples of information warfare and disinformation campaigns. <a href="http://time.com/5565991/russia-influence-2016-election/"></a>During the 2016 US presidential election</a>, Russia hacked the Hillary Clinton campaign, released politically damaging information and spread fake news and propaganda on social media. However, Russia is not meddling only in the United States. There have been <a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/">several pro-Kremlin disinformation cases</a> in the Eastern Partnership countries and in the European Union. According to the Action Plan against disinformation, Russia‚Äôs information warfare poses the greatest threat to the EU, but <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2017">reports suggest</a> that already over 30 countries are using disinformation campaigns. For example, there is evidence of <a href="https://www.noted.co.nz/currently/world/china-taiwan-disinformation-testing-ground/">China‚Äôs interference in Taiwan</a>. Information warfare can give foreign outside actors a possibility to interfere with free elections and therefore threaten democracy and its legitimacy by manipulating the public opinion. Free elections are at risk if the outcome of the elections can be effected with information warfare. Disinformation campaigns and information warfare are often part of hybrid warfare involving cyberattacks and hacking of networks, which can not only destabilize our democracy but also build mistrust and polarization.

                                 <h3>3. Key Actors</h3>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Social media companies:</b> Fake news spread online, especially on social media. Social media is mainly owned by big companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google and the co-operation with these companies is necessary in order to fight fake news. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The European Union:</b> The EU can implement new regulations in order to force social media companies to be more transparent or improve cybersecurity. The EU can also start new initiatives to tackle disinformation. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The Member States:</b> Many Member States have their own units or task forces that work against disinformation and information warfare. One way to address this is through education: for example Finland launched an anti-fake news initiative in 2014.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The Eastern Partnership:</b> The Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Moldova) are threatened by pro-Kremlin trolls. <a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/">During the past year there have been more pro-Kremlin disinformation cases in Ukraine than in the whole EU combined.</a> 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Non-governmental organisations:</b> Due to the rising amount of misinformation, fact-checking has also become more and more important. Several non-governmental organisations have their own projects and initiatives against misinformation. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The users:</b> The users of online and social media have a major impact on how misinformation spreads in the internet. Media literacy and cybersafety skills are important skills for online users.  
                                 </p>
                                 
      
                                 <h3>4. Key Institutions</h3>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA):</b> <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa">ENISA is the centre for cybersecurity expertise</a> in the European Union. It works together with the Member States by creating recommendations and supporting policy making and implementation. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The European External Action Service (EEAS):</b> The European External Action Service is the diplomatic service of foreign and defense ministries in the EU. <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/2116/-questions-and-answers-about-the-east-stratcom-task-force_en">The EEAS East Stratcom Task Force</a> analyses disinformation trends, exposes disinformation campaigns and raises awareness of disinformation coming from the Russian state. Another important EEAS cell is <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-2788_en.htm">the Hybrid Fusion Cell</a> which works to tackle hybrid threats including information warfare.  
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
                                 <p>
                                       Information warfare is a complicated issue with multiple stakeholders including private companies, countries and agencies which makes it difficult to tackle the whole issue. 

                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       Firstly, information warfare tactics are constantly evolving. Information warfare tactics include flooding the information zone with fake bots and websites, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/23/what-do-we-do-about-deepfake-video-ai-facebook">deep-fake videos</a>, manipulating search results, spreading hacked or wrong information and encouraging groups that use polarising narratives. The tools to spread disinformation evolve rapidly which means that the response against them needs to evolve even more quickly. 
 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       Secondly, it is difficult to fight against fake bots, since some people do not even see the difference between a fake account and a real person. <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/can-computer-programs-flag-fake-news">People are bad at spotting fake news</a> and eventually ordinary citizens end up sharing disinformation on social media. This makes it even harder to find out the source of disinformation. Sadly, not a lot of research has been done in this field to be able to fully understand and grasp the causes of people not being able to differentiate fake from real news.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       Thirdly, we have to address cybersecurity. If confidential information gets into the wrong hands, it can be a powerful weapon as was seen during the 2016 US presidential election. Preventing hacking attacks and proactively identifying new threats in technology is extremely important.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       Yet another issue is the lack of transparency in the data that the government and the social media companies gather. <a  href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/05/fake-news-is-bad-news-democracy/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f5e0d96f8765">Transparency in general is an important part of the issue</a>.  In a highly transparent society it is harder to spread fake narratives than in a society where trustworthy information is hard to access. A threatening view is also that people spreading disinformation might cooperate with political groups. For example, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/17/europes-far-right-divided-over-russia-as-salvini-stages-pre-election-rally-in-milan">Russia has supported populist groups</a> that they believe would weaken the unity of the European Union. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       To conclude, constantly evolving tactics, the actions of users, lack of transparency and flaws in cybersecurity are among the main issues which make tackling information warfare more difficult and challenging.
                                 </p>

                                 <h3>6. What has been done so far?</h3>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Cybersecurity Act:</b> <a  href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/cybersecurity-act-2018-dec-11_en">The European Union‚Äôs Cybersecurity Act</a> reaches to strengthen the cybersecurity in all the Member States and it also gave a permanent mandate to ENISA. This stakeholder is now an independent center of expertise that is responsible for supporting Member States in case of cyberattacks, helping in policy development and raising awareness about the issue. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Action Plan against Disinformation:</b> In 2018 the European Commission also launched an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/action-plan-against-disinformation">Action Plan against Disinformation</a>. The Action plan is based on four pillars, which include improving the Unions capability to detect disinformation, strengthening coordinated responses to disinformation, mobilizing private sector to tackle disinformation and raising awareness about the issue.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The European External Action Service East Stratcom Task Force:</b> <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/2116/-questions-and-answers-about-the-east-stratcom-task-force_en">The Task Force</a> was created in order to fight the disinformation spread by Russia. It analyses and exposes disinformation campaigns, but also raises awareness. The Task Force is also the organisation behind <a href="https://euvsdisinfo.eu/">the EU vs Disinformation campaign</a>, which gathers information on pro-Kremlin disinformation cases. The Task Force uses mainly the budget for EU Strategic Communication, but in 2018 it was granted 1,1 million and in 2019 3 million in order to address Russia‚Äôs disinformation. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Education initiatives:</b> Several Member States have also come up with different ways to battle fake news. One way to address the problem is through education: for example, the Finnish government launched <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/05/europe/finland-fake-news-intl/">an anti-fake news initiative</a> already in 2014. It aims to teach citizens the difference between fake and real news. In a study including 35 countries, Finland ranked first out in resilience to the post-truth phenomenon. Other countries close to Russia are also trying to educate their citizens about the problem and Ukraine is another example of doing so. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/22/705809811/students-in-ukraine-learn-how-to-spot-fake-stories-propaganda-and-hate-speech?t=1559681046570">A Ukrainian initiative</a> reaches to have media literacy training for 8th and 9th graders. The results have been promising: students were twice as likely to detect hate speech and 18 percent better at identifying fake news than students who weren‚Äôt on media literacy lessons.

                                 <h3>1. The topic at a glance</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    Human trafficking is a phenomenon involving the intentional exploitation of people against their own will by forcefully making them work, prostitute, give away organs for sale or beg. It is a grave violation of human rights, specifically prohibited by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/aid-development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/eu-charter-fundamental-rights_en">Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union</a>. Prevention of this criminal activity is especially challenging due to the wide variety of factors contributing to a particular person being likely to become a victim of trafficking. This is currently the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/citizens-corner/trafficking-explained">second largest source</a> of illicit income after drug dealing, and it is often associated with other forms of organised crime. The necessity for providing adequate help for victims further adds to the complexity of the issue, as they often come from outside of the EU (with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20181204_data-collection-study.pdf">58.5% of all victims</a> of trafficking registered in the EU in 2016 coming from outside of its borders). Appropriate assistance must be case-specific, as factors such as age, gender, health, and nationality play a vital role in identifying the proper means of treatment of victims. Human  trafficking is a multi-layer issue where human lives are at stake. 
                                 </p>

Less frequent forms of trafficking involve forcing the victim to beg or selling their organs on the black market;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr; Women become victims of trafficking more frequently than men, as they constituted <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20181204_data-collection-study.pdf">62% of all</a> registered victims in the years 2015-2016, and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20181204_data-collection-study.pdf">girls constituted 17%</a>;</li>

                                    <li>&rarr;	The <a href="http://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/Global_Report_on_TIP.pdf">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a> approximates that there are 2.45 million people trafficked annually around the world, 1.2 million of whom are children;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr;	Victims are often chosen by the traffickers <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/citizens-corner/trafficking-explained">based on their vulnerability</a> stemming from their economic circumstances, ethnic background, age, gender or the political situation in their country;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr; Many countries‚Äô <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/citizens-corner/trafficking-explained_en">policies are inadequate</a>, rendering the likelihood of catching a trafficker low;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr; The demand in wealthier countries or urban areas for <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/citizens-corner/trafficking-explained">prostitution and cheap labour</a> force intensifies the rate of occurrence of trafficking;</li>

                                 <h3>3. Key Actors</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; <b>Member States</b> are in charge of implementing adequate legislation, and creating bodies to prevent human trafficking and fight against it. The situation varies from state to state as different countries play different roles in the trafficking system. Some tend to be mainly sources of victims, while others act as transit countries. The latter include Poland due to its geographical location between Western and Eastern Europe. An example of such a body acting on a national level is the <b><a href="http://www.handelludzmi.eu/hle/institutions/interministerial-commit/6193,Committee-for-Combatting-and-Preventing-Trafficking-in-Human-Beings.html#Committee">Committee for Combating and Preventing Trafficking in Human Beings in Poland</a></b>. It aims to develop and adopt legislative acts outlining the approach law enforcement and public administration should take to minimise the issue of trafficking. It is an advisory body available directly to the Prime Minister.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    The EU‚Äôs power in this matter is limited to the supportive competences, which means that the EU may not pass legislative acts binding to Member States, and it is up to them to implement any legislation. The EU may only facilitate this process by creating guidelines, plans or institutions to monitor it and further help Member States develop policies.  An example of such assistance would be passing the <i><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/node/3434">Directive 2004/81/EC</a></i> or <i><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:TOC">Directive 2011/36/EU</a></i> by the European Commission.

                                 <h3>4. Key Institutions</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; <b><a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/anti-human-trafficking/greta">Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA)</a></b> is a specialised group of experts from different fields and different countries, whose task is to publish reports evaluating measures taken by Member States to fulfil the <a href="http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008371d">Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings by the Parties</a>.

The Coordinator also oversees the implementation of EU legislation against trafficking, namely the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/node/4037">EU Strategy towards the eradication of trafficking in human beings 2012-2016</a> and the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/20171204_communication_reporting_on_follow-up_to_the_eu_strategy_towards_the_eradication_of_trafficking_in_human_beings.pdf">December 2017 Communication stepping up EU Action</a> to address trafficking in human beings

                                 <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>Prevention</b> - while solving existing cases of trafficking is important, it is also crucial for the EU to ensure no more people will be trafficked in the future. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/citizens-corner/trafficking-explained">Many factors are at play</a> when it comes to one being prone to becoming a victim, including age, sex, ethnic background, economic circumstances and state of health. Vulnerable people, often unaware of the risks associated with trafficking, are more likely to accept seemingly appealing job opportunities or other offers from traffickers and are thus forced into the system. Furthermore, jobs such as the sex industry and prostitution are considered <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/key_concepts_in_a_nutshell.pdf">high-risk factors</a> as well. Many countries in the EU have undertaken preventive measures, such as the campaigns for raising awareness among students, teachers, and people present in areas associated with trafficking in Croatia. However, other Member States need to adjust their legislation to achieve the objectives set out by the EU. For example, <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/5b3e0a9c4.html?fbclid=IwAR0cwbNwZjtsESxDOYTQ8ly7aVO0OyThffnZx0BNGXW7PLbE5xQxqJE79Ic">Romanian authorities</a> and legal bodies do not have sufficient power to take action in this area. Police are not allowed to conduct unannounced workplace inspections, while the government cannot punish recruitment agencies for trafficking-related crimes, despite both of the listed competences being potentially effective.

                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>Prosecution of criminals</b> - human trafficking is a form of large organised crime, with a network of criminals working together to facilitate the movement of people, sell their services, and take control of new victims. Not prosecuting and not punishing the criminals <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/key_concepts_in_a_nutshell.pdf">leads to a further increase</a> in both the demand for and the supply of trafficked people. This applies to criminal proceedings against both people responsible for trafficking, and those knowingly using the services provided by the former. Data collection during the criminal proceedings may also be obstructed due to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Stockholm-syndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> sometimes displayed by the victims. Due to the crime being international, and characterised by a large number of people involved in trafficking a single person, the prosecution of them is hard to conduct by one country alone, and Member States policies tend to focus on their national level only, omitting cross-border cooperation, but even the action taken on the mentioned level is inadequate in a number of cases. There is a need of improving existing information exchange structures so as to increase the efficiency of data collection, and providing specialised training for police officers and judges because of their lack of insight and proper sensitivity towards trafficking cases, as has been reported <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/5b3e0a9c4.html?fbclid=IwAR0cwbNwZjtsESxDOYTQ8ly7aVO0OyThffnZx0BNGXW7PLbE5xQxqJE79Ic">in regard to Romania</a>.
 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>Appropriate treatment of victims</b> - taking an adequate approach to treating victims is a case-specific issue. The same factors that contribute to the vulnerability of a victim are playing a vital role in adjusting the actions taken after setting them free. Additionally, their experiences from the time being trafficked should also be taken into consideration. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2011:101:TOC">Appropriate treatment entails</a> refraining from unnecessary victimisation, ensuring access to proper health care, providing legal counselling, and safeguarding unassisted children. Appropriate treatment is crucial if the victims are to come back to their regular life. The effects of trafficking can be both short-term, and long-term, varying from physical to psychological damage. Victims may also lose their jobs due to the long periods of absence, or be forced to commit crimes, registering them as criminal offenders. Since those offences are committed under threat and not under normal circumstances, the victims should not be held accountable for them. Although some Member States do comply with the regulations set by the European Commission, there is considerable room for improvement among others. For instance, Romania is a significant source of victims with nearly <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20181204_data-collection-study.pdf">three quarters of victims</a> in 2015-2016 being recruited there. Nevertheless, their <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20181204_data-collection-study.pdf">policies in all areas</a> of this topic are lacking, with their victim protection legislation not providing reimbursement for the medical care or for more than one mental health counselling session. Most of the actions in regard to their treatment are taken by NGOs, but the national law prevents the government from financing them, with the result of this country not meeting the EU expectations in this matter.
                                 </p>

                                 <p>
                                    <i><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/node/3434">Directive 2004/81/EC</a></i> on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities, published by the European Commision, grants victims coming from outside the EU borders a ‚Äúreflection period‚Äù, during which they cannot be forcefully sent back to their country of origin, and are offered access to medical help in order to recover. They are also able to cooperate with the authorities, and thus obtain a temporary residence permit, enabling access to the job market, vocational training, and education.
                                 </p>

The approach of the directive is victim-focused, setting clear goals in regard to their treatment through means such as special assistance for children, preventing unnecessary victimisation during the criminal proceeding, offering guardians for unassisted minors, and legal counselling. It also sets the direction Member States should take to reduce the underlying causes of trafficking and calls for cross-border cooperation between them.

                                 <h3>1. The topic at a glance</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    Let us take the example of Maria, an EU official, whose nine-year old son Jonas has an intellectual disability. As a part of the EU staff, she has a right to enrol her son in a European School without any costs. His application was rejected three times. Jonas is now attending a special school for children with disabilities. He is one of the many students forced to leave ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù education, as investigated by <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/12/04/sink-or-swim/barriers-children-disabilities-european-school-system">Human Rights Watch</a>.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    Despite the fact that inclusion of children with disabilities into <b><a href="https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b2215e85-1ec6-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">mainstream education</a></b> has gained an increasing support over the past two decades, <b>access</b> and <b>participation</b> are still  considerably restricted. Around 15 million children from all over the EU are estimated to have <b><a href="https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b2215e85-1ec6-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">Special educational needs (SEN)</a></b>, though the prevalence might be much higher due to different <b>national definitions</b>. Leaving school without adequate qualifications, these children are more likely to become <b><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=15993">economically inactive and unemployed</a></b> later on in their life, having the poverty rate by 70% higher than the EU average.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    School officials often pressure parents to remove their children from schools, despite the <b>limited alternatives</b> for inclusive schooling. Despite <b>legal obligations</b> the countries have after signing the <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html">UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a>, <b>accommodations</b> and other <b>support measures</b> are not thought to be systematic, moreover, for the ordinary EU citizen - they depend on the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/04/eu-students-disabilities-face-barriers-european-schools">willingness of the school officials</a>. As education is the responsibility of each Member State individually, education agendas and issues related to inclusive education also vary from one country to another. Some of the greatest obstacles include lack of adapted teaching materials and trainings, individualised professional support such as <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2018/603218/EPRS_IDA(2018)603218_EN.pdf">assistive technologies</a> and lack of accessibility.  
                                 </p>
      
                                 <h3>2. Facts</h3>
                                 <ul class=to-list>
                                    <li>&rarr; It is estimated that <a href="https://www.easpd.eu/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/Policy/Education/towards_more_inclusive_learning_environments_in_europe_easpd.pdf">between 93 and 150 million children</a> worldwide live with disabilities, with one out of five children developing <b>SEN</b> during school years;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr; Failed mainstream initiatives have led to a great number of children with SEN <a herf="http://www.enil.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Austerity-European-Report_FINAL.pdf">dropping out of school</a> and either not pursuing their education or moving to segregated schools;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr;	This issue is especially visible in countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal. In <a href="http://www.enil.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Austerity-European-Report_FINAL.pdf">Greece</a>, it is estimated that <a href="http://www.enil.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Austerity-European-Report_FINAL.pdf">180,000 children</a> with SEN are excluded from education, the vast majority of children completing only primary education;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr;	The European Commission is currently ensuring funding for around 70 children with SEN to attend private schools, some of the fees being as high as 50,000 euros per year. However, this only applies for <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/12/04/eu-students-disabilities-face-barriers-european-schools">children from EU officials</a>. While efforts have been made in order to improve the conditions of schooling for children with SEN, it is important to examine the flaws behind the strategy, which is often criticized for encouraging private schooling;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr;	While there is a positive trend for children with physical disabilities, children with <a href="http://www.inclusion-europe.org/childrights4all/images/HoV_Policy_briefing_final.pdf">intellectual disabilities</a> are often completely denied access to education due to lack of supportive measures. Italy is the only Member State where almost all (over 99%) of children with disabilities attend mainstream education;</li>
                                    <li>&rarr; Many EU Member States have shown efforts to <a href="http://www.enil.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Austerity-European-Report_FINAL.pdf">decrease the number of segregated schools</a> over the past few years. However, mainstreaming children with SEN into general schools does not always imply that appropriate support measures have been implemented to satisfy their needs;</li>
                                 </ul>

                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; <b>European Commission</b> - While it withdrew from the role of monitoring the implementation of the Convention, the European Commission shapes and suggests strategies which can be implemented throughout Member States. The <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/how-does-eu-monitor-implementation-convention">current monitoring framework</a> includes: the European Disability Forum, European Ombudsman, European Parliament, and FRA.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; <b>The EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA)</b> - Identifies practices Member States have conducted in order to implement the convention. Moreover, it examines potential <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/theme/people-disabilities">legal and social barriers</a>. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; <b>Disability Intergroup of the European Parliament</b> - An informal grouping of MEPs from all nationalities and political groups interested in <a href="http://www.edf-feph.org/disability-intergroup-european-parliament">promoting disability policies</a> in their work. As one of the oldest intergroups in the EU, it has been a vital figure in advocating and advancing the rights of persons with disabilities. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; <b>National governments</b> - As there are no legally binding EU documents in the field of education, it is the responsibility of Member States individually to implement different measures which would benefit the inclusion of students with disabilities. However, the EU can complement and <a href="https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/national-policies/eurydice/sites/eurydice/files/the_structure_of_the_european_education_systems_2018_19.pdf">support national agendas and action plans</a>. European Schools stand as an exception to this, as they are directly managed by the European Union, and not the national governments of the Member States.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       &rarr; <b>European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education</b> - An independent organisation, established in 1996, which acts as a <a href="https://www.european-agency.org/about-us">platform for collaboration between ministries of education</a> in 31 countries within the EU. It aims to improve educational policies and practices by providing evidence-based information and guidance for implementation, therefore, ensuring higher quality inclusive learning.

                                 <h3>4. Key Challenges</h3>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Absence of universally applied definition of SEN</b> - Not only is it <a href="https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b2215e85-1ec6-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1/language-en">difficult to estimate</a> the number of children with SEN, but it is also often unknown what support measures in mainstream education are needed, as certain disabilities and impairments might not be recognised by the national definition, hence cause problems when identifying the possible solution approach. 

                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>High costs of implementing the Convention</b> - Mainstream schools often do not have the funds to provide all assistance needed for inclusive learning due to a large number of forms of adaptation. Such adaptations might include quiet spaces, sensory rooms and wheelchair access. 

 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Schools labelling children with SEN for their own financial benefit</b> - As schools might receive funding in improving the quality of inclusive schooling, this increases the risk of schools labelling children with SEN only for the purpose of their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-11287193">personal benefit</a>, rather than truly providing needed accommodations and support for its students. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>Lack of education and training for the teachers</b> - Taking into account that there is  lack of education and training, teachers along with other school staff often do not have the skills and knowledge to teach and handle diverse class. The number of programs offered depends on the decisions made by  national governments in the legislative area of public schools. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                      <b>Engaging all physical actors</b> - Rather than solely focusing on obtaining financial means, it is important to engage <a href="https://www.easpd.eu/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/Policy/Education/towards_more_inclusive_learning_environments_in_europe_easpd.pdf">different social groups</a> (such as teachers, parents, students and communities) in order to fully exploit the knowledge needed for improved teacher participation. All of said actors already pose certain levels of knowledge, however, these capacities are rarely being exploited and used in the process. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The conflict between two prevailing systems</b>: <b><a href="http://www.enil.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Austerity-European-Report_FINAL.pdf"></a>inclusive and segregated schools</b> - A belief that children with SEN cannot be a part of general school environments is still highly prevalent in Member States. While <a href="https://rm.coe.int/fighting-school-segregationin-europe-throughinclusive-education-a-posi/168073fb65">segregated schools</a> are more likely to provide support measures such as assistive technologies, they also spread a stigma that these students cannot be a part of the mainstream education. Countries such as Portugal have tried implementing law regulations to close segregated schools, however, without putting much effort into ensuring mainstream schools are inclusive enough for students with SEN to attend.
                                 </p>

                                 <p>
                                    The threat of terrorism in the EU continues to increase, with 205 attacks either prevented, failed, or carried out in 2017, compared to 142 in <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/european-union-terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-2018-tesat-2018">2016</a>. At the same time, Member States‚Äô methods of counter-terror have infringed upon, not just the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/global">rights</a> of suspected terrorists, but of everyday citizens. Racial profiling, both consciously and unconsciously, continues to be used by police, most notably in ‚Äòstop and search policies,‚Äô where the Arab population is <a href="http://www.profiling.fi/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Stopped_ENGL.pdf">7.6 times</a> more likely than the white population to be stopped and searched by police. As well as this, <a href="https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/right-fair-trial">detention without trial</a> and other human rights‚Äô violations can be seen more commonly in terrorist cases, and Member States are currently relying on indiscriminate data retention and sharing to detect terrorists. For instance, the UK Parliament passed the so-called <a href="https://www.computerworlduk.com/security/draft-investigatory-powers-bill-what-you-need-know-3629116/">‚ÄòSnoopers‚Äô Charter‚Äô</a> in 2016, requiring service providers to retain all internet users‚Äô internet connection records for one year.

                                    Technology is currently changing the face of both terrorism and counter-terrorism. Just as technology makes communicating and obtaining information far easier in our everyday lives, it is also a cheap and easy-to-integrate medium for terrorist groups that nullifies geographical barriers. However, because terrorism cases without a ‚Äòdigital footprint‚Äô are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamescarafano/2015/07/22/how-to-take-terrorists-off-online-take-them-on-off-line/#74bd3a764f88">increasingly rare</a>, technology also presents new opportunities for efficient and effective counter-terror. <b>Artificial Intelligence <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/staying-ahead-of-terrorists/">(AI)</a></b> is being used to detect and remove terrorist propaganda on social media platforms, and <b>hashes</b>, digital fingerprints of terrorist propaganda, can be shared between different social media platforms to better detect propaganda that is circulated on multiple sites. Technology can also be used to disseminate <b>counter-narratives</b>, messages that can come in various forms to deconstruct, discredit, or undercut extremist ideology. Though these newer methods may have the potential to shift towards a less invasive counter-terrorism strategy, it is important to remain cautious. The shortfalls of these methods, both in terms of their effectiveness and the ways in which they may instead curtail rights, must be considered.

                                 <h3>3. Key Actors</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>Terrorist groups</b> across the ideological spectrum play an important role in extremist recruitment and radicalisation, such as by disseminating terrorist propaganda. They are also important in planning and carrying out some terrorist attacks, though there is an increasing number of <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/security/20180703STO07127/terrorism-in-the-eu-since-2015">‚Äòlone wolf‚Äô</a> incidences. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>Social media platforms:</b> Social media platforms are especially important because it is the place where terrorist groups can communicate and plan attacks, disseminate propaganda for recruitment purposes, and fundraise. Social media platforms are developing <b>AI</b> to detect and remove terrorist content and sharing <b>hashes</b> with other social media companies so that propaganda posts can be recognised and deleted more quickly on various <a href="http://theconversation.com/how-tech-companies-are-successfully-disrupting-terrorist-social-media-activity-98594">platforms</a>. It is important to note that, though the social media giants, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, are commonly used by terrorist groups, smaller or newer social media platforms should not be neglected. <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/main-reports/terrorism-situation-and-trend-report-2019-te-sat">Telegram</a> remains the platform of choice for al-Qaeda and ISIS sympathisers.  
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs):</b> NGOs, such as the <a href="https://www.counterextremism.com/about">Counter Extremism Project</a> and the <a href="https://www.counterextremism.org/resources/details/id/509/active-change-foundation">Active Change Foundation</a> are important for a number of resources such as providing research, front-line assistance, and possibly developing policy with the EU and the Member States. 
                                 </p>
                                 

                                 <h3>4. Key Institutions</h3>
                                 <p>
                                       <b>The European Commission:</b> The Commission is particularly important as it is responsible for proposing new EU legislation that can be adopted by the parliament to tackle terrorism. Currently in counter-terror, one of the commission‚Äôs main roles is to provide assistance  and research to Member States so they can develop their own effective counter-terror policies, in accordance with the goals the Commission sets out. The Commission is also important in cooperating and coordinating work with other key stakeholders, such as other countries and social media companies. 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <b>Member States:</b> Member States, particularly local law enforcement, are a key stakeholder. Often, local law enforcement are the first to deal with cases involving terrorist activity, and social and community workers may be on-hand to deal with at-risk individuals. The EU shares competences with Member States over security, and it is often Member States that have the greatest control over the implementation and specifics of EU counter-terror strategies. Member States have very different approaches to counter-terror. Whilst the UK takes a more hard-line stance, allowing for  the longest maximum time for <a href="https://justice.org.uk/pre-charge-detention-terrorism-cases/">pre-trial detention</a> in Europe for terrorist cases, Denmark‚Äôs <a href="https://borgenproject.org/aarhus-model-denmark-prevents-jihad-fighters/">‚ÄòAarhus Model‚Äô</a> takes a softer approach, aiming to reintegrate returned fighters into Danish society and placing a premium on the inclusion of radicalised youth in society.  
                                 </p>
                                 
                                 <h3>Key Conflicts and Key Challenges</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; Individual rights, primarily those of freedom of speech and privacy, conflict with the collective right of security. It is important to consider whether EU measures already in place, such as those for intelligence-gathering that involve a great deal of data collection and sharing, sufficiently protect rights to privacy in pursuit of security. Rights are also contentious when it comes to terrorist propaganda and communication online. For instance, <b>‚Äògrey areas‚Äô</b> of terrorist propaganda raise questions about the dividing line between an exercise of freedom of speech and terrorist content.  

                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; Technology is constantly evolving, which has several implications. Firstly, this means that capabilities for terrorists are constantly increasing and diversifying, which is something policy-makers must account for in order to achieve a dynamic counter-terror strategy. For instance, terrorist groups are turning to cryptocurrencies and illegal money transfer systems, such as <b>hawala</b>, which means that tracing the flow of terrorist funds is becoming increasingly difficult. Secondly, evolving technology also presents new opportunities to carry out counter-terror more effectively. However, there are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2018/05/15/the-problem-with-using-ai-to-fight-terrorism-on-social-media/#b9ae3696fed3">issues</a> with using this new technology in counter-terror, which may be <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/facebook-algorithms-are-making-it-harder/588931/">ineffective</a> initially, or take time to develop. For instance, <b>AI</b> is a promising, but very new measure. <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/staying-ahead-of-terrorists/">Machine-learning</a> is used so <b>AI</b> can recognise extremist propaganda, which may be time-consuming and leads to questions about what classes as extremist propaganda. Indeed, the majority of terrorist propaganda does not actually make <a hre="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lbth-v-b-160713.pdf">reference to violence</a>, so there are numerous <b>‚Äògrey areas‚Äô</b> where AI could be less effective, or <a href="https://theconversation.com/big-tech-is-overselling-ai-as-the-solution-to-online-extremism-102077">even delete the posts of human rights activists by mistake</a>.  
 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    &rarr; The need for cooperation with and regulation of social media companies can cause difficulties, as these are private companies, often with headquarters and offices outside the EU. There are also issues with smaller companies, which may lack the resources of tech giants to deal with terrorist content or communications on their sites.

                                    <b>The <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/eu-internet-referal-unit-eu-iru">EU internet referral unit</a></b> was established in July 2015 by Europol. It aims to coordinate and share the flagging tasks of terrorist content online with relevant partners (mostly local law enforcement and social media platforms), carry out referrals to these partners, and advise both Member States and the private sector by providing strategic analysis on how best to detect and remove terrorist content online.

                                    The European Commission set out the <b>2018 <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/soteu2018-factsheet-terrorist-content_en_0.pdf">State of the European Union rules</a></b>, which aim to counter terrorist activity online. For social media companies, strong penalties are set out for systematic non-compliance with removal orders for online terrorist content, such as 4% of a company‚Äôs global turnover in the previous year. A key proposal is the ‚Äòone hour rule,‚Äô where the Commission sets out a legally binding one-hour deadline for social media companies to remove terrorist content following the receipt of a removal order issued by national authorities. Hosting service providers are also required to inform users when their content is taken down, have an effective complaint mechanism in place, and use human oversight where automated detection tools (such as <b>AI</b>) are used. Member States are also required by the Commission to guarantee the right to challenge removal order.

                                       <b>Freedom of movement</b> is considered one of the fundamental rights of the European Union (EU). <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=EU_citizens_living_in_another_Member_State_-_statistical_overview">Around 3.8%</a> of citizens in the working age live in a different Member State than where they are legally assigned. Furthermore, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Migration_and_migrant_population_statistics">22.3</a> million people, which is 4.4% of the whole population of all Member States do not have EU citizenship. Since at the beginning most of them do not possess a proper legal status, their <b>rights</b> are <b>limited</b> and they may fear being reported. Thus, they rarely seek help in health services, which has an especially strong impact on <b>pregnant women</b>, who <b>are <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/330092/6-Migrant-womens-health-issues-irregular-status.pdf?ua=1">afraid</a></b> to use <b>maternal healthcare</b> as well as <b>midwifery</b>.

                                 <p>
                                       Midwifery is one of the <b>principles</b> of health and well-being of women and infants. In the <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/277740/Pathways-to-strengthening-midwifery-in-Europe.pdf?ua=1">Scandinavian</a> countries, there is a <b>strong</b> midwifery practice, midwives provide <b>primary care</b> and there is an emphasis put on <b>positive birthing atmosphere</b>. There is a <b>contrast</b> regarding the <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/277740/Pathways-to-strengthening-midwifery-in-Europe.pdf?ua=1">Eastern Europe</a> (e.g., Hungary, Czech Republic), as there the maternal healthcare is described as rather <b>weak</b>, and some midwives were even sentenced to <b>prison</b>, while conforming to the international laws. There are existing <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/277740/Pathways-to-strengthening-midwifery-in-Europe.pdf?ua=1">problems</a> with childbearing in Europe including  growing poverty and social inequalities, connected with increased migration and widely available services would help to <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/277740/Pathways-to-strengthening-midwifery-in-Europe.pdf?ua=1">reduce</a> health inequalities.

                                       It is proven that migrant women experience <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282764659_Maternal_mortality_and_severe_morbidity_in_a_migration_perspective">higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates</a>. They often have more complex health needs, which is a result of their difficult circumstances, including cultural backgrounds (e.g., negative attitude to contraception), as well as the obstacles met during escaping the country of origin. There is a lack of clear policies and information regarding their <b>entitlement</b> to <b>healthcare services</b>, thus seeking help by them is significantly harder than for the EU citizens. Additionally, there are crucial <b>language</b> and <b>communication</b> problems, followed by a lack of <b>financial capacity</b> to cover the fees of medical assistance.  The Committee on Women‚Äôs Rights and Gender Equality in found in its 2019 <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2019/608874/IPOL_STU(2019)608874_EN.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0eadoBvRwjlNWXTdehzPPkxyFwFTaJTdTQ_lsPlYyM9INq01B9a__E8M8#page=6">report</a> that the only way to improve the situation is to grant the migrant women access to <b>maternal</b> as well as <b>reproductive healthcare</b>, including better family planning, antenatal and postnatal services, followed by the research into maternal morbidity and mortality.

Due to their status, their access to proper health assistance is highly limited.  It leads to dangerous activities such as <b>self-medicating</b> or contacting settled at their fatherland doctors, which cannot provide them with a proper physical check, rather than seeing a professional in the place of current residence.

                                       <p>
                                             The introduction of Penicillin, in the first half of the 20th century, was the first step into the ‚Äúgolden era‚Äù of antimicrobials, more specifically, antibiotics. Such medicines have saved <a href="https://www.jpiamr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/JPIAMR_SRIA_final.pdf">millions of lives</a> from once-lethal infections.
                                             However, the negative impacts of  such a medical phenomenon have finally shown themselves. The <b>overuse and misuse</b> of antimicrobials and poor infection control practices have led to a rising number of microorganisms resistant to treatments.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                             Microorganisms developed resistance through mutations or acquisition of new genetic information.  They adapted to the new environment and to many of our previously effective treatments. Even instances of infections resistant to <b>multidrug
                                             therapies and last resort treatments</b> have <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/amr/sites/amr/files/amr_action_plan_2017_en.pdf">significantly increased</a> within the EU.

                                             The World Health Organization (WHO), now considers AMR  a major threat to human and animal health worldwide. ‚Äú<a href="https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/">This serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the
                                             potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country.</a>" The approach to this issue has been commonly linked to the <b>‚ÄòOne Health‚Äô</b> concept, which recognises the link between <b>humans, livestock and environment</b> regarding the evolution of AMR.

                                       <h4 class="small-headings">Accessibilty</h4>
                                       <p>
                                             Global Public Health is under threat, the rise of AMR challenges the core of modern medicine leading to several worldwide stakeholders  attempting to <b>constrain its development.</b> The view that the <b>total consumption of antimicrobials</b> is the critical factor in the increasing resistance to antimicrobials is supported by much of the evidence
                                             we have, however this is not a simple correlation. <a href="https://www.who.int/drugresistance/WHO_Global_Strategy_English.pdf">The paradox</a> inherent to AMR is that the <b>lack of access</b> to antimicrobials in some areas of the globe, <b>poor-adherence and sub-standard medicines</b> also contribute to the development of resistance.
                                       </p>
                                       <h4 class="small-headings">Research</h4>
                                       <p>
                                             The increase of resistant strains has not been matched by the discovery of new therapeuticals. <b>The discovery, development, manufacture and marketing of new antimicrobials</b> has significantly slowed down in the past 20 years. The lack of a sustainable and predictable economy forced the <b>Pharmaceutical Industry</b> to stepback from antimicrobials. Due to health professionals taking a more responsible approach and prescribing fewer
                                             antibiotics, and certain bacteria strains developing resistance, the profit companies earn making antimicrobials has staggered. While the antimicrobials sector seems less appealing,  the investment on chronic diseases‚Äô treatments appears as <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/193736/9789241509763_eng.pdf?sequence=1">safer options</a>. The current economic model prevents the Industry from increasing its efforts on tackling AMR.

                                             From the <b>health care workers to patients</b>, everyone has a key role in the development of resistance. <b>Inadequate prescribing</b> can be a consequence of medical staff lacking up-to-date information, having reduced access to effective diagnostic tools to identify the type of infection, yield to patient pressure to prescribe antibiotics, or benefit financially from supplying the medicines. Furthermore, in <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/193736/9789241509763_eng.pdf?sequence=1">most countries</a>, antimicrobials
                                             can even be bought <b>without prescription</b>, and the <b>poor quality</b> of such medicines worsens the effect it may have on pathogens.
                                       </p>
                                       <h4 class="small-headings">Industry</h4>

                                             Regarding the Industry related to <a href="http://www.fao.org/antimicrobial-resistance/key-sectors/animal-production/en/">animal husbandry</a>, a common practice is feeding the animals with antimicrobials. The goals are to preserve the livestock health and to <b>promote its growth</b>. In comparison, extensive and smallholder livestock production use fewer antimicrobials than industrial companies. The use of antimicrobials as growth promoters leads to an increase in profit, however it enhances the emergence and spread of AMR, since most of the antimicrobials used <b>end up on the environment unmetabolized</b>.

                                       <h4 class="small-headings">Political Approach</h4>
                                       <p>
                                             In June 2017, the <b>European Commission</b> strengthened its position on the matter, by adopting the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/amr/sites/amr/files/amr_action_plan_2017_en.pdf">EU One Health Action Plan against AMR</a>. The plan is built on three main pillars: making the EU a <b>best practice region; boosting research, development and innovation</b> and <b>shaping the global agenda.</b> It stands as a symbol of political cooperation and contains concrete interdependent actions, it‚Äôs success relies on a combined effort from all the Member States and EU Institutions.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                             Since AMR was considered a global threat, the <b>WHO</b> has made a wide variety of efforts to lead the fight against it. The most recent is the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/193736/9789241509763_eng.pdf?sequence=1">Global Action Plan</a>, endorsed in May 2015. It is considered a step towards the harmonisation of an immediate action on a global scale. The need for a ‚ÄòOne Health approach‚Äô is emphasized on the plan, urging the <b>coordination among sectors</b> such as human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, finance, environment, and well informed consumers. The <b>tripartite:</b> WHO, FAO and OIE is a collaboration that serves as a role model for the multi sectoral approach needed.

                                             The Davos Declaration, signed by more than 100 companies, sets the motto for an effort of the Private sector. The <a href="https://www.amrindustryalliance.org/industry-roadmap-for-progress-on-combating-antimicrobial-resistance/">AMR Industry Alliance</a> brings together biotech, diagnostics, generics and research-based pharmaceutical companies. The aim is to guide the <b>life-science industry</b> in: investing in Research and Development (R&D) to meet public health needs; improving access to high-quality antibiotics; working to reduce the development of antimicrobial resistance and supporting measures to reduce environmental impact from the production of antibiotics. The Alliance is also focused on the need of creating a <b>sustainable and predictable market.</b>

                                             A public-private partnership, called <b>The Innovative Medicines Initiative</b>, was created in 2007  between the European Commission, and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) with the goal of improving the competitive situation of the European Union in the field of pharmaceutical research. Its programme <b>New Drugs 4 Bad Bugs</b> is an <a href="https://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/projects/IMI_AMR_2017_LR.pdf">unprecedented partnership</a>, with a ‚Ç¨700 million budget.
